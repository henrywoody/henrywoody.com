                An artificially intelligent player for Snake. The snake's brain is a neural network and is improved using the genetic algorithm. Written in Python using Pygame for graphics/user interaction. Evolution handled by <router-link to="/projects/holland">Holland</router-link>.

            <h2>Snake Anatomy</h2>

            <p>
                Snakes have 5 eyes and can see the closest object that falls along the straight line starting at the snake's head at the angle of the eye.
            </p>

            <p>
                Snakes brains are neural nets with one hidden layer, 15 input nodes, and 5 output nodes. The 15 inputs correspond to the inputs of the eyes. Each eye receives 3 inputsâ€”2 are the visual encoding of the object, and the final is the distance from the snake's head to the object. Each of the 5 output nodes correspond to turning in the direction of one of the snake's eyes (one eye points forward so this is just not turning).
